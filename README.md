I made this so that my roomates and I can see at a glance when the next trains will be arriving at our nearest marta station, It is runs on a Raspberry pi
by our apartment door.
This program requires the MARTA API, info found at https://www.itsmarta.com/app-developer-resources.aspx
station is hard coded to Five Points because that is the primary station I get on the train at, this can be changed by just changing the trains variable initilization in the update function
